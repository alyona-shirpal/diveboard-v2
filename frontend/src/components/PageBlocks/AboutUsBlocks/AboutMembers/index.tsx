        <h3>Alexander Casassovici</h3>
        <p>
          Alex is a serial entrepreneur, occasional code monkey (especially since the start of
          Diveboard).
          He got hooked to diving while passing his PADI openwater on the French Riviera. He's now a
          CMAS 2* As a computer geek he loves the metrics and the gadgets - he got his hands early
          on a Mares M2 dive computer and a underwater housing for his Olympus Âµ camera. Probably
          time to upgrade both of those!
          Alex focuses on the Web and cuddles the servers.

        <h3>Pascal Manchon</h3>
        <p>
          Pascal has been spending a lot of time doing IT Project/Program Management for big
          corporations, especially for Telco operators.
          DiveBoard has been the highly inspiring occasion of reconnecting with first loves: coding
          C++ and HTML/Javascript.
          He discovered scuba diving a few years ago and really got addicted when diving on
          especially beautiful sites like the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. Now he's always
          looking for places where to go next!
